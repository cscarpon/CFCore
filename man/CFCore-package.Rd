\title{CFCore: Core Spatial and Point Cloud Utilities for CloudFlux}
\description{
Provides core, UI-agnostic utilities for processing and analyzing spatial raster data, vector geometries, and LiDAR point clouds. The package supports continuous change detection workflows (e.g., DTM and nDSM differencing), spatial masking and reprojection, raster alignment and resampling, point cloud denoising, and ICP-based alignment helpers. Designed as the computational backbone for the CloudFlux ecosystem, CFCore is suitable for use in APIs, command-line pipelines, and interactive applications.
