Description: 
    Provides core, UI-agnostic utilities for processing and analyzing spatial
    raster data, vector geometries, and LiDAR point clouds. The package supports
    continuous change detection workflows (e.g., DTM and nDSM differencing),
    spatial masking and reprojection, raster alignment and resampling, point
    cloud denoising, and ICP-based alignment helpers. Designed as the computational
    backbone for the CloudFlux ecosystem, CFCore is suitable for use in APIs,
    command-line pipelines, and interactive applications.
